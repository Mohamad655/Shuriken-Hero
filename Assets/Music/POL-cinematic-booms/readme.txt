PlayOnLoop was launched in 2010 as one of the first Royalty-free music loops sites with a wide variety of music genres and mood and plenty of downloadable freebies added every month. Since then PlayOnloop has continued its growth as one of the most affordable and original music libraries around with a wide fanbase that loves the music and the friendly customer support, and finally in 2020 a new category dedicated to Sound Effects has been introduced.
